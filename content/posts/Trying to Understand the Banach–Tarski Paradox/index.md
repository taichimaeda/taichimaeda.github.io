## Introduction

Here's a list of questions (and hopefully the answers) I had when reading through the proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox:

- Not as surprising if one understands Vitali sets
- But still important to produce a result that is completely counterintuitive
- Because axioms cannot be proven or disproven, so we have to rely on intuition to justify them

- Mix of MIT and Chicago notes
- Lemma 5.3 in Chicago notes can be simplified by using the argument in MIT notes
- Chicago notes explain the motivation behind arccos 1/3 that it is an irrational multiple of pi unlike MIT notes
- Chicago notes explain the reassembly of orbits Pi in terms of reassembly of free group F2 first 
- Chicago notes explain the reassembly of orbits Pi require extra handling of identity element
- MIT notes explain equidecomposability in terms of groups while Chicago notes does not define it
- Should explain that when there are countably many points in D, then any rotation theta of D that maps at least one point in D to another point in D is only countably many. Since the difference of uncountable set [0,pi] and countable set of theta is non empty, we can pick a rotation that does not map any point in D to another point in D (not a fixpoint).
- Should clarify S(A) does not contain reduced/simplified words and S(A)M denotes Cartesian product of S(A) with M
- Should explain that excluding the set of fixpoints D is necessary to ensure the partitions of orbits Pi are disjoint 
- Should clarify that two points in L\D belonging to the same orbit is an equivalence relation
  - Because we show that each point can be reached from another by a unique rotation in F2 and thus the orbits form a quotient set partitioning the unit ball excluding the fixpoints.
  - Note that the orbits are identified by group generated by F2 and thus can involve both rotations in F2
  - The Axiom of Choice is used to select one point from each of these disjoint orbits. Chicago notes are not precise in this regard.
- Each point must be reached by a unique rotation in group generated by F2 so that the orbits S(A)M union ... etc. do not overlap.
  - Notice to enforce this uniqueness we needed to remove fixpoints D before taking M
- Should clarify which subsets of the unit ball are non Lebesgue measurable. Probably the set of points M in Chicago notes because like Vitali set V, shifting M by rotation in F2 countably many times and taking union of them results in a set whose measure is bounded above by the measure of the unit ball (which is 1) and below by (or rather equal to) the measure of the unit ball minus fixpoints and origin (which is again 1). We can prove this by the same argument as Vitali sets i.e. countably infinite sum of non-zero measure values is infinite.
- Should compare construction with Vitali sets. Both use the Axiom of Choice to select uncountably many points by choosing one from each countably-sized set, of which there are uncountably many.
- Should use Rodrigues' rotation formula instead of matrix calculations to derive that there is no non-trivial identity
- should take less detour (especially construction of free groups of rotation groups)
- Should prove that Lebesgue measure of points lying on countably many lines is zero in n>1 dimensions

The Sierpiński–Mazurkiewicz paradox:

- Does not use axiom of choice
- Not surprising because set E has measure zero so 2*0=0
- Harvard notes explores lots of foundational ideas for Banach–Tarski paradox
- In fact the core result that excludes fixpoints D is known as Hausdorff Paradox
- Theorem 5 in Harvard notes handles identity in free group F2 at the group-level rather than matrix-level in Chicago notes
- Theorem 5 in Harvard notes actually applies to the Sierpiński–Mazurkiewicz paradox too not just Banach–Tarski paradox
- Theorem 4 in Harvard notes says that words generated by sigma and tau acting on origin 0 produces set E
  - Sigma and tau form the free group S
  - Orbits of S from the origin 0 produces the set E (tau=z+1 increments coefficient while sigma=rz shifts the power of r^n to r^(n+1))
- In Sierpiński–Mazurkiewicz paradox, S(sigma) union S(sigma^-1) corresponds to the set of polynomials without constant term and S(tau) union S(tau^-1) corresponds to the set of polynomials with constant term.
  - Applying sigma to S(sigma) union S(sigma^-1) results in S(sigma) union sigmaS(sigma^-1)
  - Applying tau to S(tau) union S(tau^-1) results in S(tau) union tauS(tau^-1)
  - Notice the S(sigma) is unchanged by sigma and S(tau) is unchanged by tau.
  - So the same argument of decomposition of free groups of rotations/isometries applies to the Sierpiński–Mazurkiewicz paradox as well.
- Harvard notes heavily uses the notion of paradoxical sets
  - The caveat in the definition of paradoxical sets is that the sets A1,A2,... and B1,B2,... must be pairwise disjoint, including between A1 and B1 etc. (not just between A1 and A2 etc.)

Proof Lebesgue measure of countablly many points is zero:
<!-- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2433952/prove-countable-sets-have-measure-0 -->

Infimum of Xi is zero - proven by showing Xi can be any epsilon>0
Supremum of Xi is 1 - prove by showing Xi can be any c<1
